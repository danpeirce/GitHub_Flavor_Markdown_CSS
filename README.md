# GitHub Flavor Markdown Style Sheet
The following Markdown CSS is based on [Chris Patuzzo's](https://github.com/tuzz) [_github.css_](https://gist.github.com/tuzz/3331384). Feel free to further customize it. At the moment, there is only a "light version" available.

## This Fork

So far I have looked at this only superficially. All I wanted was a style sheet that gave an appearance close to Github so that [https://github.com/danpeirce/md-viewer](https://github.com/danpeirce/md-viewer) output would be rendered to look like a Github readme.md files (when desired).

So far I have not been concerned with the table of contents information listed in the other sections.

I have changed the name of the style sheet to GitHubFlavor.css as I don't want a space in the file name.
